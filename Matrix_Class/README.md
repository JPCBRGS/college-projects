# Dynamic matrix manipulation and ragged arrays
This project contains a class that's able to create and manipulate a dynamic allocated matrix in two formats: the traditional one and the ragged form (that stores all the matrix in a single array). The class is able to create matrices of different variable types (since it uses the template generic type T), handle them and accomplish several operations with these matrices. Also, the matrix doesn't need to have a consistent number of columns, and the number of rows and columns can always be resized. Variables used are mostly dynamic allocated and the program contains good software practices with no memory leaks.

## Programming concepts included in this project:
- Basic programming concepts: conditionals, loops, functions, recursivity, and more
- Pointers and references
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Object oriented programming
- Templates

Also, there are two files, a pdf one that contains a more detailed explanation of how this program works and a file named "Experimentos.txt" that contains some experiments comparing these two types of matrices and their efficiency (on my machine), but these files are in portuguese only.
