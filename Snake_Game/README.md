# Snake game using lists and object oriented programming
This program was fully written in the C++ language and contain three classes with their header files and C++ files and the **JogoSnake.cpp** file that contains a user interface implementation using then ncurses library and if you you compile this file along with your classes you will have game.

## Commands used to compile this game:
**Remember that you need to have the ncurses library installed on your machine for the game to work properly**
In the terminal, use: g++ jogoSnake.cpp Snake.cpp Game.cpp Screen.cpp -lncurses -o jogoSnake.exe

## Main programming concepts included here:
- Basic programming: conditionals, loops, functions and more
- Pointers and references
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Object oriented programming
- Data structures (the snake is a double linked list of nodes)

Also, the pdf file contains a better explanation of how this code should work, feel free to read, but this document is all written in portuguese.
